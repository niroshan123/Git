/// Steps to all git commands

Git --> version control system in local machine
GitHub --> remote environment hoster the codes that are in local machines

Respository -> The main location the where the project is stored
Branches --> Copy of the original project
Commit --> Save the changes made
---push,pull,status,add,commit,branchh,checkout,stash,rebase,reset--

Assueme there are 4 users

Person A - Creates the project and make the repository
Person B - Pull the Repository
Person C - Pull the Repository
Person D - Pull the Repository


Creator - 
1) git init (making it a git repository)
2) git add --all (stage all changes - like confirming all are to be added)
   git add personB.txt (stage specific file)
3) git status (details of the changes and other details)
4) git commit -m "my commit message" (save the feature)
5) git log (shows the commit history and the users)
6) create a repository in GitHub
7) git remote add origin https://github.com/niroshan123/Git.git (Link the local repo with remote repository)
8) git push -u origin main (put the content from local machine to the remote machine -u use at the very first time only)
-----------------------------------------------------
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/niroshan123/Git.git
git push -u origin main

Other members to clone the project---------

git clone https://github.com/niroshan123/Git

Now you can check where the brach you are with git status

To create your feature you have to create a seperated brach from master branch

git checkout -b B/create-feature

Now the all things in master brach will appear to to your new branch and make changes you want to develop your new feature 

to check what are the changes you have done

git status

Add(stage) all the changes

git add --all

Commit the changes for your branch

git commit -m "B/Feature commit name"

Push to the branch

git push origin B/create-feature

Pull Request

This is something that a scrum master does. Assume that we have made a feature hich is running weel on our local machine and you as the developer
wants to put that in to master. But before that it should be varified by the senior developer. So that you can requet the scrum manster to
make a pull request from your branch and merch if that works well. So the scrum master will go to github -> pull request tab and will choose main branch and your brach to make pull request
So if there is no conflict then he can merge your branch with main branch so main branch will have yours new feature

There by once other developers develop there own feature they also can request scrum manster to do a pull request of there feature branches and merge if that
works well. And after those are merged to get the newly added feature developers can pull the main branch and update there project to the latests.

For that(local mater brach walata latest versions pull karaganna)

git checkout main

git pull origin main


To change to a specific branch from main branch( git checkout B/create-feature )
